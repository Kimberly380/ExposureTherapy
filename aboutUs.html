            <p>
                We are a team of developers in the making, all of whom were working in other industries until just weeks before the launch of this app. We built this web app while studying at  world-renowned Code Fellows Portland. Our goals were twofold: to showcase what we've learned from the Code Fellows curriculum and to help sufferers of debilitating phobias. Among us are two individuals with arachnophobia. We were thus highly motivated to create an app that was not just intuititive to use, but also uniquely empathetic in its approach to what is undoubtedly a daunting endeavor for fellow arachnophobes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a phobia sufferer, we hope Conquer It! assists you in overcoming your fear. If not, we hope you find the site interesting and will share it with people in your life who suffer from arachnophobia.
